# Stamps for the precomputed results of the vignettes ---------------------------
#
# Results that take hours to compute are saved in vignettes/*.rds by the
# scripts in dev/. Each carries the MD5 of the Stan program that made it (or
# that the posterior regression test showed to give the same posterior), so
# that a vignette can say when its results may be out of date.
