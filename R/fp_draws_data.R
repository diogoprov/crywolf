#' Detection histories over the draws of a classifier calibration
#'
#' Builds one version of the data per posterior draw of the calibration
#' exported by sheepdog (`calibration_draws.parquet`, the probability that
#' a prediction with a given score is a true detection, at each site and
#' species), for [fp_occu_mc()]. In each version an occasion is a detection
#' when at least one of its predictions is judged true under that draw.
#'
#' @param x An export read by [fp_read_sheepdog()], with calibration draws.
#'   Read it with `species` set to the target species.
#' @param rule How a prediction is judged true under a draw with
#'   probability `p` of being true: `"sample"` (default) draws it true with
#'   probability `p`, so that no threshold is involved; `"threshold"` takes
#'   it as true when `p >= p_min`, as `sheepdog::history_draws()` does.
#' @param p_min Threshold of `rule = "threshold"`.
#' @param n_draws Optional number of calibration draws to use (the first
#'   ones, in the order of their identifiers); all by default.
#' @param seed Optional seed of `rule = "sample"`. The random numbers of
#'   the session continue afterwards as if the call had drawn none.
#' @param occasions The occasions, one row per `site` and `occasion_id` of
#'   the export, with the column `site` names (the sites of the model, such
#'   as site-nights) and any detection covariates. Defaults to
#'   `x$occasions`. Every version carries a copy of it, so keep only the
#'   columns the model needs when there are many occasions and draws.
#' @param sites The sites table of [fp_data()], with the column `site`
#'   names. Defaults to `x$sites`.
#' @param site Column of `occasions` and `sites` that identifies the sites
#'   of the model.
#'
#' @details
#' **The rules.** `"sample"` judges each prediction on its own, so an
#' occasion with many low-scoring predictions is likely to hold at least one
#' judged true; it assumes that the predictions of an occasion are true or
#' false independently, given the calibration. `"threshold"` keeps only the
#' predictions the calibration is nearly sure of, so it gives fewer
#' detections: on the `curiango` data (custom classifier, minute
#' occasions), about 8% of the minutes with `"sample"` against about 1%
#' with `"threshold"`.
#'
#' When the calibration has keys beyond site and species
#' (`schema$calibration$keys`, such as `"month"`), a prediction takes the
#' value of its occasion: each such key is a column of the occasions of the
#' export and of `calibration_draws.parquet`. In an export of schema
#' version 1.0, without a `month` column, the month is taken from the
#' recording date of the occasion.
#'
#' A prediction takes the calibration value of the grid point nearest its
#' score, as in sheepdog: grid index
#' `round((score - grid_min) / grid_step) + 1`, within the grid. A prediction without calibration draws (no draws
#' for its site, species and keys, or a key missing for its occasion) cannot be scored: its occasion is
#' set to `NA` (not surveyed) in every version, with a warning, rather than
#' counted as a non-detection.
#'
#' **Histories drawn by sheepdog.** An export of schema 1.2 may hold the
#' histories sheepdog drew with `sheepdog::occasion_draws()`
#' (`occasion_draws.parquet`), by the same rules. They are read instead of
#' drawn again when they were made for the target species with the same
#' `rule`, the same `seed` (`"sample"`, which then needs `seed`) or
#' `p_min` (`"threshold"`), at least the draws asked for, and every
#' prediction has its occasion in `occasions`; the values are the same.
#'
#' The recordings annotated by ear (`x$verified`) are the verified
#' occasions of every version: they do not depend on the calibration. The
#' reviewed clips (`x$validation`) are not used here; they are the data of
#' the calibration.
#'
#' Histories built this way hold few false positives, so a false-positive
#' process fitted to them (the default of [fp_occu()]) is informed mostly by
#' its priors; compare with `fp = NULL`.
#'
#' @return A list of [fp_data()] objects, one per calibration draw, with
#'   the attributes `draws` (the draw identifiers) and `rule`.
